    "* Data Story telling: The graph should be simple and maybe interactive but mostly used to tell a high level store for decision makers to understand what the story is about in someshort number of seconds.\n",
    "* Data showcasing: show a lot of data to analysts / data scientists / quants / researchers so that they can draw their own conclusions. Make data very contextual and can by more busy so people can get some value and opinions from it\n",
    "* Data Art: Creative and controvertial art based on data. The data art is good tool to inform general public / non technical people who might be swayed or conviced in one direction or another without requiring any specific technical knowledge. Example coule be a carecature of big creature eating small one and labels representing different forces or countries."
